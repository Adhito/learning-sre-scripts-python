# Learning SRE Scripts with Python

A personal learning repository focused on building **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** tools and automation using **Python**.  
This project serves as a hands-on collection of scripts exploring reliability, monitoring, automation, and DevOps practices.

---

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This repository contains various Python scripts written while learning concepts and tools commonly used in **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**.  
Each script aims to automate or explore a specific operational task â€” such as system monitoring, cloud API interaction, or Kubernetes management.

> ðŸ§© The goal: build practical understanding through small, reusable automation experiments.
